                <h4> Book Overview</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Story of an old lady(80+) with no direct family, living in her nephew's house in a village.
                      The whole village considers her crazy, as she keeps mumbling random meaningless somethings.
                      But apparently all those random mumblings are meaningful when taken in context - whether or not
                      God exists? Who created humans? Who created God? Of truth and deception, life and deathâ€¦ and matters
                      beyond the realm.She is gifted with one supernatural sensory power(what others write off as hallucinations!)
                      via which she percepts the origin of anything that comes in contact with her.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Along with this root theme, which creates interesting conversations, there are glimpses of regular
                        rustic village life of 70s. Houses made of mud and clay, usage of jaggery water as welcome drink,
                        disinfecting the floor using cow dung, travelling on foot or at max bullock carts, things people do in
                       their regular day to day lives.</p></li>
